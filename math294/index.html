        <p><a href='syllabus.pdf'>Syllabus</a></p>
        <p><a href="w1th.pdf">Week 1 Thursday</a> and the <a href="w1th_solns.pdf">Solutions</a> to the exercises</p>
        <p><a href="w2tues.pdf">Week 2 Tuesday</a>. Here are some notes on propositional logic, they may be a bit advanced but hopefully will be of some use: <a href="https://rynchn.github.io/math/math414-2021sp/note1-proplogic.pdf">Link</a>.</p>
        <p>I also suggest <a href="https://builds.openlogicproject.org/open-logic-complete.pdf">this textbook</a> for propositional (Ch2) and first order (Ch 3) logic, which may be better suited to this course.</p>
        <p><a href="logicnotes294.pdf">Week 2 Thursday notes</a>, we will continue working on the exercises from Tuesday as well as <a href="w2th.pdf">these</a>.</p>
        <p>Here are the <a href="w2_solns.pdf">solutions to all week 2 exercises</a>, as well as a <a href="https://math.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Mathematical_Logic_and_Proof/Book%3A_Mathematical_Reasoning__Writing_and_Proof_(Sundstrom)/03%3A_Constructing_and_Writing_Proofs_in_Mathematics">link to a textbook</a> that is more appropriate for this level (I finally found one!)</p>
